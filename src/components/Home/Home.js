        <br></br>Hi Earthling! We are husband and wife Percy and Ginny, and we are so happy to welcome you. We are the settlers on Mars and have discovered an amazing world full of undiscovered riches. Mars has a plathora of treasures, including the most wonderous rocks and minerals.  We have set up a small shop so that you can bring a little bit of marvelous Mars into your home. We sell rocks fit for all occasions, be it a graduation gift, a wedding present, or a commerative token. We hope you'll come stay with us soon in our B&B, Bolts and Batteries stop-over. In the meantime, check our photo-blog of all the beautiful places to visit on Mars.
